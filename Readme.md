# GHOST
### 项目介绍
GHOST: A hybrid stock prediction framework with sentiment-guided integration of Mamba selection layer and Stock-wise Tokens Layer, effectively solving computational complexity challenges while leveraging GDELT multimodal sentiment analysis to enhance prediction robustness during market volatility. Empirical evaluations on CSI300 and NASDAQ datasets demonstrate the framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in directional classification and risk-adjusted returns, providing reliable support for quantitative investment decisions.
